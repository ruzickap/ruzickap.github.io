Here are a few photos of my 2-year-old [TP-Link
TL-WR1043ND](https://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?model=TL-WR1043ND) wifi
router. It was getting some pictures from camera using
[fswebcam](https://web.archive.org/web/20130621044049/http://www.firestorm.cx/fswebcam/) and measuring internal/external
temperature using [digitemp](https://www.digitemp.com/).

All that time it was running:

Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.
