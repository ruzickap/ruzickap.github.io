I decided to move this blog to [Google's Blogger](https://www.blogger.com),
because I don't want to run my own server (hardware) any more. The domain will
be the same, but all the RSS feeds and pages will have a new structure.

The [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org) engine is much better than Google's,
but there are no free hosting services where you can use your own domain (not to
buy one).

I found just these:

- [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
- [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com)
- [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com)
- [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com)

I'll do the change in next month or two...

I promise I'll be more active in writing articles on new platform.
Thanks

PetrR
